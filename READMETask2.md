# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Overview
### This repository contains scripts for performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The analysis aims to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends, and prepare the dataset for further modeling.

# Dataset
### The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived the disaster.
```bash
     Dataset Source: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
     File: titanic.csv
```
# Data Cleaning
### Steps
#### 1.Load the Dataset: Read the dataset into a DataFrame.
#### 2.Handle Missing Values: Identify and impute or drop missing values.
#### 3.Feature Engineering: Create or transform features as necessary.
#### 4.Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numeric formats.
#### 5.Normalize or Standardize Data: If needed, normalize or standardize numerical features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Steps
#### 1.Understand Data Distribution: Visualize the distribution of key variables.
#### 2.Analyze Relationships: Explore relationships between variables using correlation and scatter plots.
#### 3.Identify Patterns: Look for patterns and trends in the data.
