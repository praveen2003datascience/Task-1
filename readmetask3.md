# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
# Overview
This repository contains a project for building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, which includes demographic and behavioral data about customers. The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features.
```bash
           Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing
           File: bank.csv
```
# Description: 
### The dataset includes features such as age, job, marital status, education, and various contact-related features.
# Project Structure
### 1.`data/`: Contains the dataset file.
### 2.`scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
### 3.`notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
### 4.`requirements`.txt: Lists the required Python libraries.

# Installation
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

# Clone the Repository:
```bash
          git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```
# Install Required Libraries:
### Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```bash
          pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Data Processing
## Load and Preprocess Data
Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

# Model Training
## Train the Decision Tree Classifier
Build and train a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.

# Visualization (Optional)
Visualize the Decision Tree (Optional) Visualize the trained Decision Tree to understand the decision-making process.

# Instructions
## 1.Prepare the Dataset:
Ensure the dataset file (bank.csv) is placed in the data/ directory.
## 2.Run the Data Processing Script:
Execute the script in the scripts/ directory to preprocess the data.
## 3.Train the Model:
Run the model training script to build and evaluate the Decision Tree Classifier.

## 4.Visualize the Decision Tree (Optional):
Use the provided code to visualize the trained Decision Tree.
